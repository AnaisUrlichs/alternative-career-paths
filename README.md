Hi there, my name is Anais. I started off with a Bachelor in Infomration management. Halfway through the degree I decided to drop out to persue an online degree in Computer Science and to work full time.
The following years, I transitioned between different roles at startups in the cryptocurrencies space. While it was tough to gain experience at first, I eventually found my fit as Developer Advocate. After 3 years in the blockchain space, I decided it was time for a change and transitioned industies. This led me to work in the cloud native space. 

Your career path does not have to be linear & you definitely do not need a degree to get started and to gain experience. The only thing is you need is people who believe in you and give you a chance.
